Kadı is an automated testing and grading tool for "Introduction to programming" course in Gebze Technical University.

We used [bootstrap-scss-gulp-starter-kit](https://github.com/dmxt/bootstrap-scss-gulp-starter-kit) *(Thanks dmxt!)* to save some time (we didn't have that much).

##### 1. `cd gulp`
##### 2. `npm install`
##### 3. `gulp`
